add root node to queue
    - possible answers = all answers
    - guesses = 0

while queue isnt empty {
    node = queue.pop
        - each node has a cumulative hint, list of possible answers, number of guesses (i.e. depth), and number of paths leading to it
    for each guess {
        for each possible answer {
            pretend this answer is the answer
            get the hint
            find all the other answers that this hint could point to
            remove them from remaining answers
            add to the list a node with these answers, this hint, depth + 1
        }
    }
    sort guesses by eliminations

}

ways to specify a pool of answers:
    - list of indeces
    - predicate (cumulative hint)
        - multiple predicates could result in the same pool of answers
